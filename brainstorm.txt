Two main problems right now:
- How to integrate all of the different datasheets?
- Do I want to make this profitable?

Being profitable will take too much time right now and may have too much of a quality drop. I'll skip it for now. I can probably convert everything over later if I want to.

How to integrate? First: what are the parameters, how much data are we talking about?
- Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Oscars give out limited numbers of awards, so it might be possible to do those manually, but Rotten Tomatoes would be hard. I might be able to skip Rotten Tomatoes, though. But I should really build a tool that integrates these for scalability. One way to do this would be to match the title and year against other movies to try to find the right one.
- May need to redo some of this with a more recent dataset
